Level 1 – Pure Beginner Practice

7. Ask user’s age and check if eligible to vote
If age >= 18 → “Eligible”, else → “Not eligible”

8. Print multiplication table of 5
Use loop to print 5 × 1 to 5 × 10.

9. Count how many numbers between 1 and 15 are greater than 8
Loop and count conditionally.

10. Ask user for password and print access status
Hardcoded correct password. Compare with user input.

Level 2 – Slightly Tougher but Logical
11. Allow only 3 attempts to enter correct password
If user gets it right early, stop. If not → “Account locked”
